1. Initialize dp with 1 because each element is a subsequence of itself.

prev -> 0 to < cur

2. if arr[cur] > arr[prev] and subsequence length of cur < subsequence length of prev + 1, add dp[cur] = dp[prev] + 1

3. take the max of dp, because it is containing the subsequence length

4. If they asked subset means there is no ordering, so, first sort the arr and then do the procedure of LIS
